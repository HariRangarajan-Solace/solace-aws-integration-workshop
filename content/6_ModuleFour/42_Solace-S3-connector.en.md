## Introduction
In this section we will be linking the S3 bucket with the Solace event mesh using the Solace-S3 native connector.

### Setting up the connector

#### Step 1 - Select service
- Navigate to the cloud console and login to the PubSub+ broker manager using the link in the top right corner
![S3 - Link PubSub+ broker manager - Allow Access](/static/images/moduleOne/broker_console.png)
- Click on the **Connectors** link on the left menu and click on **Create a new connector**
- Select the AWS logo --> the AWS S3 bucket and click **Authenticate**

#### Step 2 - Authenticate
- Fill in the following details in the first step and click **Connector setup**
  - Connector name : Put in a name of your choice
  - Access key id : Put in the **Access key** that you retrieved from the cloudformation console.
  - Access key : Put in the **Secret Access key** that you retrieved from the cloudformation console
  - Bucket name : Name of the bucket that you created
  - Bucket region : The region of the bucket where you created. In our case, it was `ap-northeast-1` \
Below is a screenshot of the step for your reference

#### Step 3 - Connector setup
- Proceed with the retrieved value in the **Connector Setup** as below

#### Step 4 - Subscription setup
In this step, we define the folder structure where the events will be persisted. \
We use Substitution Expressions which are a Solace-specific expression language used to replace specific text attributes (request targets, request headers, etc.) with system generated output.
You can read more about them over here : [Substitution Expressions](https://docs.solace.com/Messaging/Substitution-Expressions-Overview.htm)
- Use the following values for the subscription setup :
    - File name mapping function : `/quote-engine/APAC-Region/${localYear()}/${localMonth()}/${localDay()}/${localHour()}/${topic(3)}/${topic(4)}-${now()}`
    - Subscriptions : `TW/TWSE/LIVE/*`
- Click on **Create and Enable Connector**

#### Step 5 - Connected
This step details the results of the asset creation result and its operational state

#### Step 6 - Optimising
To make sure that the rate of pushing events to the S3 bucket is optimized, we will be :
- Increasing the number of concurrent connections
- Making the queue backing the connector as **Non-exclusive**
1. Go to the newly created connector as below :

2. Click on the **rest Consumer** row as shown below :
   ![S3 - RestConsumer-highlighted-step6](/static/images/moduleFour/inside-s3-connector.png)
3. Update the **Outgoing Connection Count** value by double-clicking on it to **50**
   ![S3 - Outgoing-connection-count-highlighted-step6](/static/images/moduleFour/outbound-connection-count.png)
4. On the main connector screen, click on the **Queue** row as shown below :
   ![S3 - Queue Highlighted-step6](/static/images/moduleFour/Queue-highlighted.png)
5. Click on the edit button on the queue configuration screen as shown below :
   ![S3 - Queue Configuration details-step6](/static/images/moduleFour/Queue-configuration-details.png)
6. In the **Edit Queue Settings** screen click on the access type and make it **Non-Exclusive** as shown below:
   ![S3 - Switch access type-step6](/static/images/moduleFour/switch-access-type.png)



As the events are produced on the **Remote - On premise** broker and is pushed thru to the mesh, they will be saved to the S3 bucket as files in the folder structure we defined.
