# Cleaning up resources

As a part of this workshop, a number of resources have been created which need to be cleaned up to avoid costs for you as a participant.
The cleanup activities are divided into two sections based on how they were originally created :
- Resources that you manually created as a part of the workshop.
- Resources that were created in an automated manner by the cloudformation template at the beginning of the workshop.

Please follow the instructions in the below section for the cleanup activities.
