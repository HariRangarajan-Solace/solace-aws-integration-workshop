## Introduction
In this step we will be using Cloud9 and its EC2 instance to deploy and run two custom applications for subscribing to and viewing our market data events.

### Cloud9 instance
AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. \
We will be using a Cloud9 backed EC2 instance to deploy our applications and consume events from over the mesh. \
As a part of this workshop, you will have already got a Cloud9 subscription setup. You can find this in your Cloud9 environments screen. 



In this step we will be learning how to :
- Open ports on the EC2 instance to enable network connectivity to our applications.


1. Navigate to the Cloud9 Environments and enter the Cloud9 instance created for you as a part of this workshop named Solace-AWS-Cloud9

2. Click on the **Manage EC2 Instance** button as shown
