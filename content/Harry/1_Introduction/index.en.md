# Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, businesses are constantly seeking innovative ways to handle real-time data processing, seamless integration, and responsive communication between systems. 
Event-Driven Architecture provides a powerful solution to meet these demands by enabling asynchronous, event-based communication and processing.

This workshop will introduce you to Solace, a leading messaging platform designed to simplify event-driven architectures. 
Solace acts as a central nervous system for your data, facilitating the smooth flow of events across diverse systems and applications. 
By leveraging Solace's capabilities, you can build scalable, loosely-coupled, and highly responsive systems.

## Learning Objectives 

As a part of this workshop, you will be implementing EDA in a new expansion region for a fictitious trading company.
The use case is of an edge broker feeding FX pricing to client desktop/mobile devices so that they can be eyeballed. \
There are different categories of users (categories 1-4) differentiated by the refresh rates of the data.
Below is a high level architecture diagram of the distributed landscape :

The workshop will utilize the existing infrastructure, including the fully developed "Corporate data center" and "Region London (eu-west-2)". 
During the workshop, participants will construct and integrate the comprehensive "Region APAC (ap-northeast-1)" along with its various applications into the existing landscape.

By the end of this workshop, you will have : 

- Signed up for a Solace Cloud account
- Created a developer grade broker deployed in an AWS region
- Created an event mesh with a bidirectional link between the newly created broker and an existing broker
- Used an AWS Cloud9 IDE and its EC2 instance to deploy and run admin and client consumer applications
- Create an AWS Lambda service which will be invoked by an EventBridge Scheduler
- Setup an AWS S3 bucket
- Use the Solace native AWS S3 connector to feed incoming events to the newly created S3 bucket
- Visualize the S3 bucket data using Amazon OpenSearch
